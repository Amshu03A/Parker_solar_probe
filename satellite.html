    <h1>Composition</h1>
    <p>This project costed US$1.5 billion and was 1,510 pounds (685 kilograms) at launch. <br>
        It has got:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fields Experiment (FIELDS)</li>
        <li>Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISIS )</li>
        <li>Wide Field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR)</li>
        <li>Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP)</li>
        <li>4.5-inch-thick (11.43 cm) carbon-composite shield.</li>
        </ol>
    <h1>CHALLENGES AND WORKING</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>How does the probe not melt after getting so close to the sun?<br>
        <p>The Carbon heat shield or the TPS (Thermal Protection Shield) is so strong that spacecraft stays at room temperature (85 F), even when the Sun facing side that faces 2500 F.
            <br>Fields electric wave antennas and the sweep solar probe both have their own heat shields. <br>Actuators motors to move solar rays behind the only leading edges are exposed to the sun. The illuminated surface uses the energy it gets to convert it into power that is used by the spacecraft and by other instruments.
        </p></li>
        <li>How does the cooling system work? <br>
        <p>The whole system circulates water through both arrays; hence, water is heated. This heated water gives large radiations out, behind the TPS which is thrown into space, cooling the spacecraft.</p></li>
        <li>How does the spacecraft change its position around certain areas?<br>
        <p>Autonomy decides how best to position that spacecraft with help of limb sensors that detect excessive heat, the reaction to this is that the wheels change position.</p></li>
        <li>What happens when the satellite meets space dust? <br>
        <ol>
            <li>Parker solar probe regularly experiences high speed collisions with dust particles that create explosions of plasma.</li>
            <li>During closest approach to sun and due to its speed (447,000mph/720000kph) even a tiny grain of dust can trigger explosions which could make the probe sand-blasted spacecraft ever.</li>
            <li>During the 9th of 24 total planned orbits there were periods where the parker solar probe was stuck by a hypervelocity dust grain every 12 seconds on average.</li>
