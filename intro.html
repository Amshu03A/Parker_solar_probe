    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>One of the incredible achievements of NASA and the name is coined in honour of the scientist who worked on it, Eugene Parker. The motto of this probe was “touch the sun.” It was designed and architecture by John Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.<br> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The speciality of this probe is that it is flying closer to the sun compared to any other spacecraft and will complete 24 orbits before it’s termination. It will also come 6.2 million km close to the sun.</p>
    <h1>AIM</h1>
    <p> This probe was deigned to answer questions that were born after years of curiosity. To find out: <br>
        a) Why is the Corona (outer atmosphere of the Sun) much hotter than the photosphere (The Sun’s surface)?<br>

        b) How does solar wind accelerate?<br>

        c) What are sources of high solar energy particles?</p>
