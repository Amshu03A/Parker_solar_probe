    <h1>Discoveries made:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>The WISPR instrument made the first detection of dust depletion close to sun</li>
        <li>When it sends back the 1st observations from its journey to the sun, scientists found that their magnetic field measurements spiked with what came to be known as switchbacks (or) rapid flips in sun’s magnetic field that reversed direction like a zig zagging mounted road.</li>
        <li>They also studied comets detected radio emission from Venus’s atmosphere and capture the first ever images of Venus surface in visible wavelengths.</li>
